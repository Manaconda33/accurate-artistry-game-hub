# Architecture and Product Decisions

This file is the current decision register. The complete original ADR-001 through ADR-021 record is preserved verbatim at `docs/history/DECISIONS-through-ADR-021.md` and remains authoritative except where a later ADR explicitly supersedes an earlier decision.

Future sessions must read this current register and follow the historical link when implementing behavior governed by ADR-001 through ADR-021.

## Existing governing decisions

ADR-001 through ADR-021 remain in force according to their recorded status in `docs/history/DECISIONS-through-ADR-021.md`, including repository governance, Vite/TypeScript/Three.js/Rapier/Howler baselines, Git LFS policy, slice/deployment gates, roster mapping, runtime character asset delivery, orientation rules, unique AI identity sampling, and the approved production locks for existing characters.

ADR-020's historical Cleo-to-AA-06 production mapping is superseded only with respect to **current active roster assignment** by ADR-022 below. Cleo's approved likeness, kart design, source rights, asset approvals, and historical acceptance evidence remain valid archive records.

## ADR-022: Archive Cleo and release AA-06 from active production

- **Date:** 2026-08-26
- **Status:** Approved
- **Context:** Manny directed that Cleo be removed from production while preserving her complete character package and all related work so she can be restored later if desired. Cleo was an active production identity in `characterManifest`, selectable by the player, eligible for the randomized AI grid, and mapped to AA-06 Grip Specialist.
- **Options considered:** Delete Cleo and her assets; retain Cleo as an inactive but profile-reserving production definition; preserve the full package as an archive while returning AA-06 to a governed active-roster placeholder.
- **Decision:** Remove Cleo from the active manifest and AI/player roster. Preserve her complete approved production definition as `archivedCleo`, keep every runtime PNG, GLB/LFS object, deterministic builder, character record, asset brief, hashes, mount, and prior acceptance evidence, and index them in `docs/CHARACTER-ARCHIVE.md`. Restore the active AA-06 slot to a generic placeholder and return AA-06 to `Available` in the roster ledger. Remove AA-06 GLBs from the active runtime-asset signature requirement without deleting the files.
- **Rationale:** This makes the retirement real at runtime while keeping restoration low-risk and lossless. A semantic archive avoids unnecessary LFS moves or binary churn, preserves historical evidence, maintains the PRD's twelve-slot scaffold, and prevents an inactive character from consuming a balance profile indefinitely.
- **Product impact:** Cleo no longer appears in Character Select and cannot appear as an AI racer. AA-06 remains visible only as an unfinished placeholder until a future approved character occupies it. No approved Cleo artwork or 3D work is destroyed.
- **Implementation impact:** `characterManifest` excludes Cleo; `archivedCleo` retains her former complete definition; AA-06 is a placeholder; the roster ledger marks AA-06 available; Cleo's three GLBs are no longer active build dependencies; archive/restoration documentation becomes part of the character-governance workflow.
- **Restoration gate:** Reintroducing Cleo requires explicit Manny approval, a current balance-profile decision, active-manifest reactivation, fresh runtime/LFS validation, full repository validation, deployment, and live product-owner confirmation. Historical 2026-08-21 acceptance does not substitute for current deployment evidence.
- **Approval:** Manny's explicit instruction on 2026-08-26 to remove Cleo from production while retaining her assets and related character work in an archive for possible later return.
